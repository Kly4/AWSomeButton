## AWSomeButton

This is a small project for Hackbeanpot 2016. We took 2 amazon dash buttons, used ARP interception to track button presses, and made something cool happen. We used Tide button to send a text, saying that there's a package from FedEx (UPS etc.) right in front of your door. So you don't have to keep checking when your package arrives.
Now the Finish button is the "fun" button. It's a russian roulette type of button. 50% of the time it will add, commit and push the code to your Github (after some consideration we decided to do commit history, since committing and pushing blindly turned out to be VERY dangerous) and other 50% it will go to our website and vote for either Trump or Sanders based on your internal emotional state (black magic pretty much).

#Keep in mind, this was done on no sleep, so the code is dirty and definitely needs to be cleaned/re-written.
